## stypr_decrypt

Weak but lightweight and efficient encryption/decryption algorithm. Made by Harold Kim (root@stypr.com)

## WARNING

Use this only if there's no other choice of encryption/decryption. This has to be rather called as encoding/decoding routine.

Multi-byte characters were not tested.
